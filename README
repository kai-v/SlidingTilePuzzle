Sliding tile state space : The Goal state has tiles sorted from 0 to 14 where the 0 tile is blank. 

DFID: This algorithm is a depth-limited depth-first search which is called repeatedly with larger depth bounds 
until the goal is found. The depth bounds increase by one each iteration and reports the total number of nodes expanded. 

BFS: Breadth-first search, this algorithm assumes that none of the input domains contain any cycles and with each state stores 
information to avoid generating the parent at the next level. The search terminates when the goal is found, but does not return the path that was found.
